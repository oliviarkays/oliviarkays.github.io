    <p>
        I am currently pursuing my Master’s in Library & Information Science online at the <strong>University of Missouri - Columbia</strong>. I expect to graduate in Spring 2025. I earned my undergraduate degrees from the <strong>University of Missouri - Kansas City</strong> in Spring 2022. I have a B.S. in Physics, with an astronomy emphasis, and a B.A. in Spanish Language and Literature.
        <br />
        In my free time, I enjoy reading, spending time with friends and my cats, watching TV, and playing video games. After graduation, I plan to teach English in Spain to improve my Spanish fluency. I aim to work as a librarian in either an academic or public library upon my return. I am considering a focus on <em>resource sharing</em> or other <em>backend services</em>.
