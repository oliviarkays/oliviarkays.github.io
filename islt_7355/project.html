            Description
        </h3>
    
        <p>
            I completed a work project in which I assessed student questions from our information literacy classes. We teach information literacy to three types of 
            general education classes: English 110, English 225, and Communication Studies 110. Prior to the start of each English 110 class we ask students to write 
            down one question they have about the library. In the Fall 2023 semester we tried having students submit questions before class in one of two ways. They 
            could either submit a question online following the completion of the pre-class module, or in person immediately before the class began. I compiled all of 
            the questions asked in that semester (both online and in person) and analyzed them for common questions, themes/patterns, and whether the questions were 
            answered in our lesson plan.
            <br/>
            I found the following:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>57% of the questions asked were not answered in our lesson plan</li>
                <li>The majority of questions were about checking out books</li>
                <li>Online questions were substantial more often than in person questions. In person questions were often irrelevant personal questions for the librarian</li>
            </ul>
        <p>This resulted in updates to our lesson plan and online module. I updated both in order to include information on locating and checking out books, along with 
            other items that were common questions that had previously been unanswered.
        </p>

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>I was able to form a professional looking report that suited the needs for improving our lesson plan, but required some feedback on phrasing to improve 
                the clarity when breaking down the findings, particularly when it came to conveying information about subgroups (a percentage of a percentage). I have 
                now had some training in using Voyant, a free text data mining tool, and would likely utilize that alongside my own coding in the future. If I were to 
                conduct an assessment like this for external use or publication, I would have obtained more assistance from others in the department in calibrating the 
                coding system as well.</p>
