            Description
        </h3>
    
        <p>
            I completed a Collection Evaluation Plan paper for my Collection and Access Management class (ISLT 7313, Spring 2024). It consisted of selecting a library, 
            a collection evaluation focus, and an outline of approach including the evaluation and selection of appropriate methods covered throughout the course. I 
            selected the UMKC Miller Nichols Library for an evaluation of the relevance and use of their LGBTQ+ fiction materials. I chose to determine the relevance of 
            the collection through the imprint date of materials, formats available, reading level, the presence of popular or recommended texts, and their corresponding 
            circulation statistics, and to combine that data with user perceptions which could be used in order to improve the searchability, relevance, and use of the 
            collection as well as plan for future selection in the area.
        </p>

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>This was one of my few papers with a basis solely in methods covered in class rather than being based in research, and as such required a slightly different 
                approach than I am accustomed to. It gave me an opportunity to consider how to plan and manage a project, including the comparison and selection of 
                appropriate techniques. I was able to apply some of the skills I learned at work in designing surveys, with an emphasis on user anonymity and brevity to 
                increase completion rate. If I were to do this project again it would be nice to try actually carrying out a small scale evaluation, in order to get more 
                hands-on project management experience.
